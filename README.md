# Gym Management System

A new gym requires software to record certain processes. Participants wishing to join the gym have to apply for membership. The gym expects to offer pilates, yoga, keep fit and spinning classes run by its own staff for its members, as well as allowing rooms to be used by independent teachers.The classes are run on the premises in various rooms. Classes will be organized for beginners,intermediate and advanced members. Each set of in-house classes consists of six sessions in a specified room with an assigned instructor, one per week for each type of member
and are limited to a maximum number of members.A member will contact the gym to enroll on
a specific set of classes. Classes have to be paid via credit or debit card or cash before the
sessions. The price varies according to the type of class. Once payment has been received the
member will be enrolled for the appropriate six sessions. This management system is implemented to automate the above process.
